  <h1>About(Academic)</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a physics undergraduate at <strong>IIT Madras</strong>, exploring the field of quantum technologies.
    My coursework spans the breadth of core physics subjects offered here and, to varying depths, topics in electrical engineering as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    I previously worked at <a href="8_Week_Report.pdf" target="_blank">IIT Delhi</a> under <strong>Dr. Nirat Ray</strong> during the summer of 2024.
    I am currently pursuing an ongoing research project in the <strong>SPELL lab</strong> at IIT Madras under <strong>Dr. Vidya Praveen Bhallamudi</strong>.
  </p>
  <h2>Hackathons</h2>
  <p>I took part in the Quantum Internet Application Challenge, organised by the Quantum Internet Alliance at TU Delft along with Yash Kashtikar.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately we did not win (nor did we expect to), but we were featured in the <a href = "https://quantuminternetalliance.org/2025/02/27/qia-concludes-quantum-internet-application-challenge-2024-names-best-submission/" target="_blank">Notable Submissions"</a></p>
  <p>This was my first hackathon and it was a memorable experience. What we made can be accessed here: <a href = "https://github.com/hershsam/CloQk-Synchronization" target="_blank">CloQk Synchronization</a></p>

  <h2>Course Projects </h2>
  <p>Aryan Palimkar and I worked on <a href = "https://github.com/hershsam/Quantum-Assisted-Graph-Partitioning" target="_blank">Quantum Assisted Graph Partitioning</a> for the course Quantum Computing Lab taught by Dr. Prabha Mandayam in the Jan - May 2025 semester.</p>
  <p>My grade was regrettably bad (mostly due to late/non submission of assignments) but I am happy with the final course project.</p>
